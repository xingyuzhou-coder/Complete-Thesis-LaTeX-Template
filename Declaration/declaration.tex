\noindent This is the self-translated English version of the master's thesis submitted to Degree Awarding Committee, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Compared with the Chinese version submitted in June 2021, several modifications need to be briefly explained here. Firstly, in order to more accurately highlight the theme of the thesis, the title has been changed from the original "Research on MEMS Cantilever Devices based on AlGaN/AlN/GaN Heterostructure" to "Development of Gallium Nitride Power MEMS Devices". Secondly, the Chapter Six contains the latest revisions as of April 2022, because its content is extracted from the article that I am revising and submitting as the first author. Please refer to the final published article.
