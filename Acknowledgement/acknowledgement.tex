The three-year postgraduate study career at UCAS has come to an end. During the time, I received selfless help from my parents, mentors, and classmates. They accompanied me through a pleasant study time, and I gained precious friendship in the journey of life. Here, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of them.

First of all, I would like to thank my supervisor, Professor Weiguo Hu, who has brought me a lot from his profound theoretical knowledge and deep insight into the power devices. Professor Hu pointed out the core of the problem in time when I first tried theoretical research, and clarified the direction when I was confused, which helped me successfully complete the theoretical model and gain valuable scientific research experience. I would also like to thank Professor Xiong Pu for his guidance over the past three years, which has greatly broadened my research horizons. 

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Professor Jiping Li from Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics. During the nearly seven years of study, Professor Li gave me very valuable suggestions on my learning attitude, research methods, and living life. She made pertinent and serious criticism to my shortcomings, and encouraged me to persevere in the most difficult times of my life. I grew up with her earnest teachings, and will keep her love in my heart forever.

In the short three years of my master's study, I was accompanied by my colleagues in the laboratory. I would like to thank Dr. Ting Liu, Dr. Chunyan Jiang, Dr. Liang Jing, MSc. Jiyuan Zhu and Dr. Wei Sha, for their selfless help in my research and living life. We share sorrow and joy together, and think about the puzzles and confusions in learning. Everyone give me new insights and point out the fog in front of me. I sincerely hope that they will reach new heights and achieve success in their future life.

Thanks to Dr. Ruihang Xu from the Institute of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences for his precious friendship. The acquaintance of Yanqi Lake Campus is the treasure of my life. In the past three years, we encouraged each other to explore artificial intelligence, mathematical optimization, physical modeling and philosophy of science. We also strive to establish a comprehensive understanding of Western science, to obtain truly mature scientific discoveries. "There are very few people in the world who will help us, while bosom friend even fewer". Wang Wei, a Chinese poet living more than 1,000 years ago, has a famous saying in praise of friendship. I sincerely hope that our friendship will last forever. I will never forget our ambitions and will work hard to achieve our dreams.

I am deeply grateful to my parents. They will always be my strongest backing, shield me from the wind and rain, and allow me to study without distractions. The thousands of volumes of books at home have laid the cornerstone of my life. They have not only given me all the love, but also given me the wings of Kunpeng. The former seedlings have become towering trees, and I will definitely live up to their ardent expectations.
